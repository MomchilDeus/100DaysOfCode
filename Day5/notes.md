### What I did today
I played around with 4.2.2 HTTP and did the exercises, hell fuckin' yeah ;D. I still want to make it so that clicking outside the dropdown would close it and then I can say I've done them all the way.
- I also played some "We were here" with Zlatko
  - took us 3h to get the game going, with the key being deleting ~/.config/unity3d/Total*

### What I did today (Saturday)
10.2.2018

I did have quite a bit more time today so I had some fun with the following
- ftp through cli, programs, filezilla, eclipse and so on
- installed Lubuntu-17.10 and ArchMergeD-6.4.1 (ArchMerge hung on installation at unsquash the file system)
- Bought a domain name (thingsido.space) 
- downloaded Hashbrown CMS (I want to learn node and Mongo so a project would be reeeally useful for that)
- I also tried out Lutris
  - installed Overwatch - didn't run super well, I'd say not playable competitively
  - Wildstar hung on start
- command of the day: nc (read and write tcp, udp data)

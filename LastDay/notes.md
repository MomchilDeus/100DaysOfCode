### So what happened to the 100 days of code?
I admit I haven't been coding every single day. I stayed till late at work and went early for a week so that's how it started. I've been doing a lot of Backend in my free time (Mongo, Node, Express) and also Handlebars, coz why not. 

- I haven't been complacent, but I haven't been as diligent as expected.
- I am learning stuff on the side of work, and I don't need the 100 Days per say
- This challenge came to an early end, but I might one day take it up again
